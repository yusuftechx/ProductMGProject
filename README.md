<h3>This code is a straightforward graphical user interface (GUI) application for managing products.</h3>
<p> <b>The application features a main frame with several components:</b></p>

<p>- A title label at the top</p>
<p>- Four labels and text fields for entering product information (ID, name, price, quantity)</p>
<p>- Four buttons for performing actions (add, update, delete, search)</p>
<p>- A copyright label at the bottom</P>

<p>It utilizes JFrame for the main frame, JLabel for text labels, JTextField for data entry 
  fields, and JButton for action buttons. The code defines three methods: createLabel() to 
  create a label with specified text, font, and color, createTextField() to create a text 
  field with specified bounds, and createButton()to create a button with specified text, 
  bounds, and colors. The frame is set up, components are added,and it exits the application 
  on close.</p>
